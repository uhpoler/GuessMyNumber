# GuessMyNumber
I created a mini-game project to practice and learn DOM Manipulation using Vanilla JavaScript.

- The game generates a random number between 1 and 20.
- Your goal is to guess this number with as few attempts as possible.
- Each incorrect guess deducts 1 point from your score
- The game also tracks your "High Score" as long as you continue playing.
